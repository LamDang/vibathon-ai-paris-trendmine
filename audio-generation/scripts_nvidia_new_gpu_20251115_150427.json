I’m obviously excited to see KDE going in even more consumer devices by default. Let’s hope it sells even better than the Steam Deck.\n\n[https://xeiaso.net/blog/2025/valve-is-about-to-win-the-console-generation/](https://xeiaso.net/blog/2025/valve-is-about-to-win-the-console-generation/)\n\n#### Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun To Depart And Launch AI Start-Up Focused On ‘World Models’\n\n_Tags: tech, business, ai, machine-learning, gpt_\n\nI was actually wondering when this would happen. Was just a matter of time, would have expected this move a couple of months ago.\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metas-chief-ai-scientist-yann-lecun-depart-and-launch-ai-start-focused-world-models](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metas-chief-ai-scientist-yann-lecun-depart-and-launch-ai-start-focused-world-models)\n\n#### Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks\n\n_Tags: tech, ai, machine-learning, reasoning, research_\n\nClearly needs further exploration. I’d like to see it submitted in a peer reviewed journal but maybe that will come. Still it’s nice to see people for new approaches. It’s a breath of fresh air. I like it when there are actual research rather than hype. Hopefully the days of the “scale it up and magic will happen” are counted.\n\n[https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04871](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04871)\n\n#### Introduction to IncusOS\n\n_Tags: tech, virtualization, containers, infrastructure, linux, incus_\n\nI didn’t know about this project. This sounds interesting, smart use of mkosi to make an Incus tailored system.\n\n[https://linuxcontainers.org/incus-os/](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus-os/)\n\n#### Linux process priorities demystified\n\n_Tags: tech, linux, kernel, processes, multithreading_\n\nDoes a nice job explaining how the scheduling can be investigated from outside the kernel. It is a good introduction on the topic.\n\n[https://www.sigma-star.at/blog/2022/02/linux-proc-prios/](https://www.sigma-star.at/blog/2022/02/linux-proc-prios/)\n\n#### Announcing Magika 1.0: now faster, smarter, and rebuilt in Rust\n\n_Tags: tech, filesystem, foss_\n\nLooks more and more like an interesting solution for file type detection.\n\n[https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/11/announcing-magika-10-now-faster-smarter.html?m=1](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/11/announcing-magika-10-now-faster-smarter.html?m=1)\n\n#### The (lazy) Git UI You Didn’t Know You Need\n\n_Tags: tech, git, version-control, tools_\n\nNice tour of LazyGit. I keep hearing good things about it, I should really try it.\n\n[https://www.bwplotka.dev/2025/lazygit/](https://www.bwplotka.dev/2025/lazygit/)\n\n#### Imperative to relational\n\n_Tags: tech, databases, sql, learning_\n\nLong but nice post about all the things you need to figure out about working with databases when the only thing you know is imperative languages.\n\n[https://madhadron.com/imperative_to_relational.html](https://madhadron.com/imperative_to_relational.html)\n\n#### Automated Equality Checks in C++ with Reflection (C++26)\n\n_Tags: tech, c++, metaprogramming_\n\nAnother nice use of the upcoming C++ reflection feature.\n\n[https://lemire.me/blog/2025/11/09/automated-equality-checks-in-c-with-reflection-c26/](https://lemire.me/blog/2025/11/09/automated-equality-checks-in-c-with-reflection-c26/)\n\n#### Hardening the C++ Standard Library at massive scale\n\n_Tags: tech, c++, safety, security, standard_\n\nInteresting work from Apple and Google to have better hardening in libc++. It’s nice to see it ripples through the upcoming C++26 standard as well.\n\n[https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3773097](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3773097)\n\n#### channels-console: Real-time monitoring, metrics and logs for Rust channels\n\n_Tags: tech, rust, debugging, distributed, multithreading_\n\nEarly days but this looks like interesting tooling to inspect and debug programs using Rust channels.\n\n[https://github.com/pawurb/channels-console](https://github.com/pawurb/channels-console)\n\n#### The state of the Rust dependency ecosystem\n\n_Tags: tech, rust, ecosystem, supply-chain_\n\nInteresting analysis of the crates ecosystem. It shows quite well some of the challenges and weaknesses. Nothing to worry about yet about the ecosystem health overall. Still, you should probably be careful when picking dependencies.\n\n[https://00f.net/2025/10/17/state-of-the-rust-ecosystem/](https://00f.net/2025/10/17/state-of-the-rust-ecosystem/)\n\n#### GPU Glossary\n\n_Tags: tech, gpu, hardware, learning_\n\nLooks heavy on the NVidia specifics but it looks like a very comprehensive view of the important concepts in a GPU.\n\n[https://modal.com/gpu-glossary](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary)\n\n#### The “Dependency Cutout” Workflow Pattern\n\n_Tags: tech, foss, economics, supply-chain, community_\n\nThis is indeed the best way to handle your open source dependencies. I got concerns about the ability to sell that to management though because of the extra steps. It’s also probably why you want to have an OSPO in your company, it’s a good way to lower the barrier for developers to contribute this way.\n\n[https://blog.glyph.im/2025/11/dependency-cutout-workflow-pattern.html](https://blog.glyph.im/2025/11/dependency-cutout-workflow-pattern.html)\n\n#### 100% coverage is not that trivial\n\n_Tags: tech, tests, tdd, coverage_\n\nIn a large codebase it’s not a given indeed. That’s why you want integration tests to get there.\n\n[https://blog.ploeh.dk/2025/11/10/100-coverage-is-not-that-trivial/](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2025/11/10/100-coverage-is-not-that-trivial/)\n\n#### Composable Tests\n\n_Tags: tech, tests, tdd_\n\nThis is maybe the property of tests which is the most easily misunderstood. It’s not always easy to respect it as well.\n\n[https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/composable-tests](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/composable-tests)\n\n#### Forget Chatbots. You Need a Notebook.\n\n_Tags: tech, note-taking, science, research, productivity_\n\nI had a few moment like this in my life. I definitely recommend it. I’ve never been more productive than isolated in a mountain with only books, notebooks and pens.\n\n[https://calnewport.com/forget-chatbots-you-need-a-notebook/](https://calnewport.com/forget-chatbots-you-need-a-notebook/)\n\n* * *\n\nBye for now!"
