After we saw AMD's Radeon RX 9070 and Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics cards have [finally dip below their MSRPs](https://www.techpowerup.com/342533/amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-rx-9070-xt-finally-reach-msrp), it seems that NVIDIA cards are now in order. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti slipped below its MSRP this week after Newegg applied a rebate that brought widely available listings to $729.99, under the $749 MSRP tied to this \"Blackwell\" SKU. The new pricing may not instantly alter the narrative around the 5070 Ti, but rather give this GPU some price breathing room for card that carried persistent price premiums, turning some buyers away.\n\n The SKU in question is MSI Ventus 3X OC BLACK edition, which apparently has not been listed on MSI's official site, meaning that retailers are now the exclusive place to get this GPU. We had a pleasure of reviewing the non-BLACK [MSI RTX 5070 Ti Ventus 3X OC GPU](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-ventus-3x/), which stood out as a sensible and well-rounded offering. Its factory overclock, strong headroom for further tuning and efficient gaming power draw make it especially attractive to 1440p high refresh gamers, compact-system builders and overclocking enthusiasts. Taking performance, features and price into account we awarded the Ventus 3X OC a \"Recommended\" badge. It is a very good value for its audience, but it missed our Editor's Choice due to the thermal and noise trade-offs. However, at the time the actual retail price was a bit higher than MSRP at launch. Now, PC builders can get this GPU at prices below MSRP from the [Newegg listing

I don't know, is 10db really that big a difference in real life? \n\n Of course how \"quiet\" a card is subjective, but compared to the cheap 9070XT I had this year they are mouse vs aircraft type scenarios. Overall, I never really heard them, in my daytime operations and some evening - time gaming. At least not on the level which would be intrusive and be audible over my speakers and game sounds (I don't even do headphones anymore).\n\n Also, it’s a TPU recommended card so there's that.\n\n Posted on Nov 12th 2025, 11:15[Reply](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/342857/reply?quote=5619627)[#6](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/posts/5619634)[Raptor_i](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/members/raptor_i.50662/)\n\n> KritThese small skinny cheap RTX 5070 Ti coolers are terrible in my opinion not worth to save.

Plus the option for a decent overclock without needing to tune it.\n\n Were it too noisy, that would matter, but those are temps normalised at 40dB :)\n\n Posted on Nov 12th 2025, 14:30[Reply](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/342857/reply?quote=5619814)[Add your own comment](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/342857/reply)\n\nNov 15th, 2025 07:28 CST[change timezone](https://www.techpowerup.com/342857/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-dips-below-msrp-for-the-first-time#)\n\n[Sign in](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/login) / [Register](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/register)\n\nLatest GPU Drivers\n==================\n\n*   [NVIDIA GeForce 581.80 WHQL](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/nvidia-geforce-graphics-drivers/)\n*   [AMD Radeon 25.11.1 WHQL](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/amd-radeon-graphics-drivers/)\n*   [Intel Arc & iGPU 101.8250 Beta](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/intel-integrated-graphics-drivers/)\n\n[![Image 18](https://www.techpowerup.com/reviyuu/b784/_de98d1b5.png)](https://www.techpowerup.com/reviyuu/b784/3048er/images/gmchjhj.png)\n\nNew Forum Posts\n===============\n\n*   07:27 by unwind-protect [Help with parts list for building a local backup server / NAS (for music projects)?](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/help-with-parts-list-for-building-a-local-backup-server-nas-for-music-projects.340400/unread) (27) \n*   07:20 by Ruru [Post your cooling.](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/post-your-cooling.322662/unread) (365) \n*   07:20 by Krit [RX 9000 series GPU Owners Club](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/rx-9000-series-gpu-owners-club.333786/unread) (1554) \n*   07:17 by Dr. Dro [question on asrock x58 extreme 3 and hwinfo64](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/question-on-asrock-x58-extreme-3-and-hwinfo64.342936/unread) (4) \n*   07:09 by TechBuyingHavoc [Battlefield 6](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/battlefield-6.339603/unread) (634) \n*   06:35 by AusWolf [Real difference between 9070 xt and 5080?](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/real-difference-between-9070-xt-and-5080.342869/unread) (88) \n*   06:23 by DaemonForce [1/4 pcie card in regular slot](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/1-4-pcie-card-in-regular-slot.342931/unread) (4) \n*   05:50 by ARF [What phone you use as your daily driver?

After we saw AMD's Radeon RX 9070 and Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics cards have [finally dip below their MSRPs](https://www.techpowerup.com/342533/amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-rx-9070-xt-finally-reach-msrp), it seems that NVIDIA cards are now in order. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti slipped below its MSRP this week after Newegg applied a rebate that brought widely available listings to $729.99, under the $749 MSRP tied to this \"Blackwell\" SKU. The new pricing may not instantly alter the narrative around the 5070 Ti, but rather give this GPU some price breathing room for card that carried persistent price premiums, turning some buyers away.\n\n The SKU in question is MSI Ventus 3X OC BLACK edition, which apparently has not been listed on MSI's official site, meaning that retailers are now the exclusive place to get this GPU. We had a pleasure of reviewing the non-BLACK [MSI RTX 5070 Ti Ventus 3X OC GPU](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-ventus-3x/), which stood out as a sensible and well-rounded offering. Its factory overclock, strong headroom for further tuning and efficient gaming power draw make it especially attractive to 1440p high refresh gamers, compact-system builders and overclocking enthusiasts. Taking performance, features and price into account we awarded the Ventus 3X OC a \"Recommended\" badge. It is a very good value for its audience, but it missed our Editor's Choice due to the thermal and noise trade-offs. However, at the time the actual retail price was a bit higher than MSRP at launch. Now, PC builders can get this GPU at prices below MSRP from the [Newegg listing

I don't know, is 10db really that big a difference in real life? \n\n Of course how \"quiet\" a card is subjective, but compared to the cheap 9070XT I had this year they are mouse vs aircraft type scenarios. Overall, I never really heard them, in my daytime operations and some evening - time gaming. At least not on the level which would be intrusive and be audible over my speakers and game sounds (I don't even do headphones anymore).\n\n Also, it’s a TPU recommended card so there's that.\n\n Posted on Nov 12th 2025, 11:15[Reply](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/342857/reply?quote=5619627)[#6](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/posts/5619634)[Raptor_i](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/members/raptor_i.50662/)\n\n> KritThese small skinny cheap RTX 5070 Ti coolers are terrible in my opinion not worth to save.

After we saw AMD's Radeon RX 9070 and Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics cards have [finally dip below their MSRPs](https://www.techpowerup.com/342533/amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-rx-9070-xt-finally-reach-msrp), it seems that NVIDIA cards are now in order. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti slipped below its MSRP this week after Newegg applied a rebate that brought widely available listings to $729.99, under the $749 MSRP tied to this \"Blackwell\" SKU. The new pricing may not instantly alter the narrative around the 5070 Ti, but rather give this GPU some price breathing room for card that carried persistent price premiums, turning some buyers away.\n\n The SKU in question is MSI Ventus 3X OC BLACK edition, which apparently has not been listed on MSI's official site, meaning that retailers are now the exclusive place to get this GPU. We had a pleasure of reviewing the non-BLACK [MSI RTX 5070 Ti Ventus 3X OC GPU](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-ventus-3x/), which stood out as a sensible and well-rounded offering. Its factory overclock, strong headroom for further tuning and efficient gaming power draw make it especially attractive to 1440p high refresh gamers, compact-system builders and overclocking enthusiasts. Taking performance, features and price into account we awarded the Ventus 3X OC a \"Recommended\" badge. It is a very good value for its audience, but it missed our Editor's Choice due to the thermal and noise trade-offs. However, at the time the actual retail price was a bit higher than MSRP at launch. Now, PC builders can get this GPU at prices below MSRP from the [Newegg listing

I don't know, is 10db really that big a difference in real life? \n\n Of course how \"quiet\" a card is subjective, but compared to the cheap 9070XT I had this year they are mouse vs aircraft type scenarios. Overall, I never really heard them, in my daytime operations and some evening - time gaming. At least not on the level which would be intrusive and be audible over my speakers and game sounds (I don't even do headphones anymore).\n\n Also, it’s a TPU recommended card so there's that.\n\n Posted on Nov 12th 2025, 11:15[Reply](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/342857/reply?quote=5619627)[#6](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/posts/5619634)[Raptor_i](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/members/raptor_i.50662/)\n\n> KritThese small skinny cheap RTX 5070 Ti coolers are terrible in my opinion not worth to save.

Plus the option for a decent overclock without needing to tune it.\n\n Were it too noisy, that would matter, but those are temps normalised at 40dB :)\n\n Posted on Nov 12th 2025, 14:30[Reply](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/342857/reply?quote=5619814)[Add your own comment](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/342857/reply)\n\nNov 15th, 2025 07:28 CST[change timezone](https://www.techpowerup.com/342857/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-dips-below-msrp-for-the-first-time#)\n\n[Sign in](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/login) / [Register](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/register)\n\nLatest GPU Drivers\n==================\n\n*   [NVIDIA GeForce 581.80 WHQL](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/nvidia-geforce-graphics-drivers/)\n*   [AMD Radeon 25.11.1 WHQL](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/amd-radeon-graphics-drivers/)\n*   [Intel Arc & iGPU 101.8250 Beta](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/intel-integrated-graphics-drivers/)\n\n[![Image 18](https://www.techpowerup.com/reviyuu/b784/_de98d1b5.png)](https://www.techpowerup.com/reviyuu/b784/3048er/images/gmchjhj.png)\n\nNew Forum Posts\n===============\n\n*   07:27 by unwind-protect [Help with parts list for building a local backup server / NAS (for music projects)?](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/help-with-parts-list-for-building-a-local-backup-server-nas-for-music-projects.340400/unread) (27) \n*   07:20 by Ruru [Post your cooling.](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/post-your-cooling.322662/unread) (365) \n*   07:20 by Krit [RX 9000 series GPU Owners Club](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/rx-9000-series-gpu-owners-club.333786/unread) (1554) \n*   07:17 by Dr. Dro [question on asrock x58 extreme 3 and hwinfo64](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/question-on-asrock-x58-extreme-3-and-hwinfo64.342936/unread) (4) \n*   07:09 by TechBuyingHavoc [Battlefield 6](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/battlefield-6.339603/unread) (634) \n*   06:35 by AusWolf [Real difference between 9070 xt and 5080?](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/real-difference-between-9070-xt-and-5080.342869/unread) (88) \n*   06:23 by DaemonForce [1/4 pcie card in regular slot](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/1-4-pcie-card-in-regular-slot.342931/unread) (4) \n*   05:50 by ARF [What phone you use as your daily driver?
