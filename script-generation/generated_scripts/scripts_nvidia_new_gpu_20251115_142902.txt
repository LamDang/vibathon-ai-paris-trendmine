GPU prices are finally coming down. After we saw AMD's Radeon RX 9070 and Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics cards have [finally dip below their MSRPs](https://www.techpowerup.com/342533/amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-rx-9070-xt-finally-reach-msrp), it seems that NVIDIA cards are now in order. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti slipped below its MSRP this week after Newegg applied a rebate that brought widely available listings to $729.99, under the $749 MSRP tied to this "Blackwell" SKU. The new pricing may not instantly alter the narrative around the 5070 Ti, but rather give this GPU some price breathing room for card that carried persistent price premiums, turning some buyers away.

 The SKU in question is MSI Ventus 3X OC BLACK edition, which apparently has not been listed on MSI's official site, meaning that retailers are now the exclusive place to get this GPU. We had a pleasure of reviewing the non-BLACK [MSI RTX 5070 Ti Ventus 3X OC GPU](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-ventus-3x/), which stood out as a sensible and well-rounded offering. Its factory overclock, strong headroom for further tuning and efficient gaming power draw make it especially attractive to 1440p high refresh gamers, compact-system builders and overclocking enthusiasts. Taking performance, features and price into account we awarded the Ventus 3X OC a "Recommended" badge. It is a very good value for its audience, but it missed our Editor's Choice due to the thermal and noise trade-offs. However, at the time the actual retail price was a bit higher than MSRP at launch. Now, PC builders can get this GPU at prices below MSRP from the [Newegg listing here](https://www.newegg.com/msi-rtx-5070-ti-16g-ventus-3x-oc-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-16gb-graphics-card-triple-fans/p/N82E16814137993).

These small skinny cheap RTX 5070 Ti coolers are terrible in my opinion not worth to save. Asus Prime may be bare minimum if using custom fan curve.

That's 5 or less degrees difference between most of the other cards. Totally worth saving money imo. 

 I have the PNY one, which is pretty budget. It seldom goes over 75C, and is pretty quiet. I definitely rather have the extra $$$ than run a few degrees cooler, which doesn't make any difference.

Not worth saving with how much louder the ventus cooler is.

Look at rpm and dba are you sure about that ? There are only two ways quiet card but terrible temps or loud card but decent temps.

 I had Gainward RTX 5070 Ti and i sold it because it was too loud even at low rpms (quality was poor).

I can't speak for this Ventus, but three of my last Nvidia cards were the basic models (2x Gigabyte and now the PNY) and they were all very quiet plus I never had to worry about any temps. I don't know, is 10db really that big a difference in real life? 

 Of course how "quiet" a card is subjective, but compared to the cheap 9070XT I had this year they are mouse vs aircraft type scenarios. Overall, I never really heard them, in my daytime operations and some evening - time gaming. At least not on the level which would be intrusive and be audible over my speakers and game sounds (I don't even do headphones anymore).

 Also, it’s a TPU recommended card so there's that.

Msi have the formula for quiet and cool coolers yet they put the worst in Ventus, I can't imagine it's because of the cost it's just so their other cards will look good.

The difference is that AMD are offering very good cooling for cheap but nvidia does not. Look at Sapphire Pulse or XFX Swift it costs the same as Reaper, Gigabyte Gaming OC or Steel Legend (but different tier of cooling/noise dba)

Some time ago I've commented about MSI's MSRP models (second half of that post):

 [EMBED content="post-5497677"]https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/asus-geforce-rtx-5080-tuf-oc.333022/page-2#post-5497677[/EMBED]

 There is too much segmentation going on, way too many models, the proper approach would've been making a decent cooler for the 5080 and then using it on the 5070 Ti as well.
> cinemawareI don't know, is 10db really that big a difference in real life?

40 vs 30 dBA is a big deal.

 70 vs 65°C is not a big deal.

 ^Noise normalized.

 Temps are fine in absolute terms for the Ventus, but relative to Galax which is also MSRP they're disappointing.

Every 10db is roughly double the IRL perceived loudness.

RDNA4 cards are very impressive:

 ^Samsung memory would bring those VRAM temps down.

 Not only the impressive core temp but the cards are usually lighter and less bulky than 5070 Ti ones.

 Even though, on paper, Navi 48 should be worse than GB203 when it comes to power density:

 9070 XT - 304 W TDP with 357 mm2 GPU die -> 0.85 W/mm2

 5070 Ti - 300 W TDP with 378 mm2 GPU die -> 0.79 W/ mm2

I had Gigabyte Gaming OC cards. They are cheap (relatively speaking). The cooling is excellent. The PNY I have now is also a basic model, not the one that was linked to.

 The AMD card I had was beyond terrible. 

 These are real life use case, not reviews. Disregarding the AMD angle, from my experience, spending a lot of money on higher end Nvidia cards is a waste. Maybe there are some outliers, perhaps Ventus is one, but then you should return it and get a Gigabyte or PNY.

 That is all :)

If you look at HW unboxed video where he tests all or 16 RX 9070 XT models it shows that Gaming OC is the worst model from them all. You where very unlucky when bought your choice.

Yep, this.

 10dB sounds twice as loud.

> KritGigabyte Gaming OC that's very old name since RX 5700 XT....

Ok thanx.

 Its not the worst model card on the chart though, its the 2nd highest clocked by quite a margin.

 At 2720MHz its over 5% faster (clock speed) than 2570MHz cards.

 And is nearly 10% faster than the slowest 2480MHz card.

 If it were put to the same speed as most other cards, temps would look much better. Plus the option for a decent overclock without needing to tune it.

 Were it too noisy, that would matter, but those are temps normalised at 40dB :)

GPU prices are finally coming down. After we saw AMD's Radeon RX 9070 and Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics cards have [finally dip below their MSRPs](https://www.techpowerup.com/342533/amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-rx-9070-xt-finally-reach-msrp), it seems that NVIDIA cards are now in order. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti slipped below its MSRP this week after Newegg applied a rebate that brought widely available listings to $729.99, under the $749 MSRP tied to this "Blackwell" SKU. The new pricing may not instantly alter the narrative around the 5070 Ti, but rather give this GPU some price breathing room for card that carried persistent price premiums, turning some buyers away.

 The SKU in question is MSI Ventus 3X OC BLACK edition, which apparently has not been listed on MSI's official site, meaning that retailers are now the exclusive place to get this GPU. We had a pleasure of reviewing the non-BLACK [MSI RTX 5070 Ti Ventus 3X OC GPU](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-ventus-3x/), which stood out as a sensible and well-rounded offering. Its factory overclock, strong headroom for further tuning and efficient gaming power draw make it especially attractive to 1440p high refresh gamers, compact-system builders and overclocking enthusiasts. Taking performance, features and price into account we awarded the Ventus 3X OC a "Recommended" badge. It is a very good value for its audience, but it missed our Editor's Choice due to the thermal and noise trade-offs. However, at the time the actual retail price was a bit higher than MSRP at launch. Now, PC builders can get this GPU at prices below MSRP from the [Newegg listing here](https://www.newegg.com/msi-rtx-5070-ti-16g-ventus-3x-oc-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-16gb-graphics-card-triple-fans/p/N82E16814137993).

That's 5 or less degrees difference between most of the other cards. Totally worth saving money imo. 

 I have the PNY one, which is pretty budget. It seldom goes over 75C, and is pretty quiet. I definitely rather have the extra $$$ than run a few degrees cooler, which doesn't make any difference.

Not worth saving with how much louder the ventus cooler is.

Look at rpm and dba are you sure about that ? There are only two ways quiet card but terrible temps or loud card but decent temps.

 I had Gainward RTX 5070 Ti and i sold it because it was too loud even at low rpms (quality was poor).

I can't speak for this Ventus, but three of my last Nvidia cards were the basic models (2x Gigabyte and now the PNY) and they were all very quiet plus I never had to worry about any temps. I don't know, is 10db really that big a difference in real life? 

 Of course how "quiet" a card is subjective, but compared to the cheap 9070XT I had this year they are mouse vs aircraft type scenarios. Overall, I never really heard them, in my daytime operations and some evening - time gaming. At least not on the level which would be intrusive and be audible over my speakers and game sounds (I don't even do headphones anymore).

 Also, it’s a TPU recommended card so there's that.

Msi have the formula for quiet and cool coolers yet they put the worst in Ventus, I can't imagine it's because of the cost it's just so their other cards will look good.

The difference is that AMD are offering very good cooling for cheap but nvidia does not. Look at Sapphire Pulse or XFX Swift it costs the same as Reaper, Gigabyte Gaming OC or Steel Legend (but different tier of cooling/noise dba)

Some time ago I've commented about MSI's MSRP models (second half of that post):

 [EMBED content="post-5497677"]https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/asus-geforce-rtx-5080-tuf-oc.333022/page-2#post-5497677[/EMBED]

 There is too much segmentation going on, way too many models, the proper approach would've been making a decent cooler for the 5080 and then using it on the 5070 Ti as well.
> cinemawareI don't know, is 10db really that big a difference in real life?

40 vs 30 dBA is a big deal.

 70 vs 65°C is not a big deal.

 ^Noise normalized.

 Temps are fine in absolute terms for the Ventus, but relative to Galax which is also MSRP they're disappointing.

Every 10db is roughly double the IRL perceived loudness.

 Not only the impressive core temp but the cards are usually lighter and less bulky than 5070 Ti ones.

 Even though, on paper, Navi 48 should be worse than GB203 when it comes to power density:

 9070 XT - 304 W TDP with 357 mm2 GPU die -> 0.85 W/mm2

 5070 Ti - 300 W TDP with 378 mm2 GPU die -> 0.79 W/ mm2

> KritThe difference is that AMD are offering very good cooling for cheap but nvidia does not. Look at Sapphire Pulse or XFX Swift it costs the same as Reaper, Gigabyte Gaming OC or Steel Legend (but different tier of cooling/noise dba)

I had Gigabyte Gaming OC cards. They are cheap (relatively speaking). The cooling is excellent. The PNY I have now is also a basic model, not the one that was linked to.

 The AMD card I had was beyond terrible. 

 These are real life use case, not reviews. Disregarding the AMD angle, from my experience, spending a lot of money on higher end Nvidia cards is a waste. Maybe there are some outliers, perhaps Ventus is one, but then you should return it and get a Gigabyte or PNY.

 That is all :)

If you look at HW unboxed video where he tests all or 16 RX 9070 XT models it shows that Gaming OC is the worst model from them all. You where very unlucky when bought your choice.

> cinemawareI don't know, is 10db really that big a difference in real life?

> razaronEvery 10db is roughly double the IRL perceived loudness.

Yep, this.

 10dB sounds twice as loud.

Gigabyte Gaming OC that's very old name since RX 5700 XT....

> KritGigabyte Gaming OC that's very old name since RX 5700 XT....

Ok thanx.

 Its not the worst model card on the chart though, its the 2nd highest clocked by quite a margin.

 At 2720MHz its over 5% faster (clock speed) than 2570MHz cards.

 And is nearly 10% faster than the slowest 2480MHz card.

 If it were put to the same speed as most other cards, temps would look much better. Plus the option for a decent overclock without needing to tune it.

 Were it too noisy, that would matter, but those are temps normalised at 40dB :)
