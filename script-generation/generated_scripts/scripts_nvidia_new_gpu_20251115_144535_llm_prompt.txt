Let’s go for my web review for the week 2025-46.

#### Valve is about to win the console generation

_Tags: tech, valve, kde, hardware, gaming, desktop_

Early days, we’ll need to see the pricing and reviews. I’m obviously excited to see KDE going in even more consumer devices by default. Let’s hope it sells even better than the Steam Deck.

[https://xeiaso.net/blog/2025/valve-is-about-to-win-the-console-generation/](https://xeiaso.net/blog/2025/valve-is-about-to-win-the-console-generation/)

#### Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun To Depart And Launch AI Start-Up Focused On ‘World Models’

_Tags: tech, business, ai, machine-learning, gpt_

I was actually wondering when this would happen. Was just a matter of time, would have expected this move a couple of months ago.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metas-chief-ai-scientist-yann-lecun-depart-and-launch-ai-start-focused-world-models](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metas-chief-ai-scientist-yann-lecun-depart-and-launch-ai-start-focused-world-models)

#### Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks

_Tags: tech, ai, machine-learning, reasoning, research_

Clearly needs further exploration. I’d like to see it submitted in a peer reviewed journal but maybe that will come. Still it’s nice to see people for new approaches. It’s a breath of fresh air. I like it when there are actual research rather than hype. Hopefully the days of the “scale it up and magic will happen” are counted.

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04871](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04871)

#### Introduction to IncusOS

_Tags: tech, virtualization, containers, infrastructure, linux, incus_

I didn’t know about this project. This sounds interesting, smart use of mkosi to make an Incus tailored system.

[https://linuxcontainers.org/incus-os/](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus-os/)

#### Linux process priorities demystified

_Tags: tech, linux, kernel, processes, multithreading_

Does a nice job explaining how the scheduling can be investigated from outside the kernel. It is a good introduction on the topic.

[https://www.sigma-star.at/blog/2022/02/linux-proc-prios/](https://www.sigma-star.at/blog/2022/02/linux-proc-prios/)

#### Announcing Magika 1.0: now faster, smarter, and rebuilt in Rust

_Tags: tech, filesystem, foss_

Looks more and more like an interesting solution for file type detection.

[https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/11/announcing-magika-10-now-faster-smarter.html?m=1](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/11/announcing-magika-10-now-faster-smarter.html?m=1)

#### The (lazy) Git UI You Didn’t Know You Need

_Tags: tech, git, version-control, tools_

Nice tour of LazyGit. I keep hearing good things about it, I should really try it.

[https://www.bwplotka.dev/2025/lazygit/](https://www.bwplotka.dev/2025/lazygit/)

#### Imperative to relational

_Tags: tech, databases, sql, learning_

Long but nice post about all the things you need to figure out about working with databases when the only thing you know is imperative languages.

[https://madhadron.com/imperative_to_relational.html](https://madhadron.com/imperative_to_relational.html)

#### Automated Equality Checks in C++ with Reflection (C++26)

_Tags: tech, c++, metaprogramming_

Another nice use of the upcoming C++ reflection feature.

[https://lemire.me/blog/2025/11/09/automated-equality-checks-in-c-with-reflection-c26/](https://lemire.me/blog/2025/11/09/automated-equality-checks-in-c-with-reflection-c26/)

#### Hardening the C++ Standard Library at massive scale

_Tags: tech, c++, safety, security, standard_

Interesting work from Apple and Google to have better hardening in libc++. It’s nice to see it ripples through the upcoming C++26 standard as well.

[https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3773097](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3773097)

#### channels-console: Real-time monitoring, metrics and logs for Rust channels

_Tags: tech, rust, debugging, distributed, multithreading_

Early days but this looks like interesting tooling to inspect and debug programs using Rust channels.

[https://github.com/pawurb/channels-console](https://github.com/pawurb/channels-console)

#### The state of the Rust dependency ecosystem

_Tags: tech, rust, ecosystem, supply-chain_

Interesting analysis of the crates ecosystem. It shows quite well some of the challenges and weaknesses. Nothing to worry about yet about the ecosystem health overall. Still, you should probably be careful when picking dependencies.

[https://00f.net/2025/10/17/state-of-the-rust-ecosystem/](https://00f.net/2025/10/17/state-of-the-rust-ecosystem/)

#### GPU Glossary

_Tags: tech, gpu, hardware, learning_

Looks heavy on the NVidia specifics but it looks like a very comprehensive view of the important concepts in a GPU.

[https://modal.com/gpu-glossary](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary)

#### The “Dependency Cutout” Workflow Pattern

_Tags: tech, foss, economics, supply-chain, community_

This is indeed the best way to handle your open source dependencies. I got concerns about the ability to sell that to management though because of the extra steps. It’s also probably why you want to have an OSPO in your company, it’s a good way to lower the barrier for developers to contribute this way.

[https://blog.glyph.im/2025/11/dependency-cutout-workflow-pattern.html](https://blog.glyph.im/2025/11/dependency-cutout-workflow-pattern.html)

#### 100% coverage is not that trivial

_Tags: tech, tests, tdd, coverage_

In a large codebase it’s not a given indeed. That’s why you want integration tests to get there.

[https://blog.ploeh.dk/2025/11/10/100-coverage-is-not-that-trivial/](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2025/11/10/100-coverage-is-not-that-trivial/)

#### Composable Tests

_Tags: tech, tests, tdd_

This is maybe the property of tests which is the most easily misunderstood. It’s not always easy to respect it as well.

[https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/composable-tests](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/composable-tests)

#### Forget Chatbots. You Need a Notebook.

_Tags: tech, note-taking, science, research, productivity_

I had a few moment like this in my life. I definitely recommend it. I’ve never been more productive than isolated in a mountain with only books, notebooks and pens.

Markdown Content:
Let’s go for my web review for the week 2025-46.

* * *

#### Valve is about to win the console generation

_Tags: tech, valve, kde, hardware, gaming, desktop_

Early days, we’ll need to see the pricing and reviews. I’m obviously excited to see KDE going in even more consumer devices by default. Let’s hope it sells even better than the Steam Deck.

[https://xeiaso.net/blog/2025/valve-is-about-to-win-the-console-generation/](https://xeiaso.net/blog/2025/valve-is-about-to-win-the-console-generation/)

#### Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun To Depart And Launch AI Start-Up Focused On ‘World Models’

_Tags: tech, business, ai, machine-learning, gpt_

I was actually wondering when this would happen. Was just a matter of time, would have expected this move a couple of months ago.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metas-chief-ai-scientist-yann-lecun-depart-and-launch-ai-start-focused-world-models](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metas-chief-ai-scientist-yann-lecun-depart-and-launch-ai-start-focused-world-models)

#### Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks

_Tags: tech, ai, machine-learning, reasoning, research_

Clearly needs further exploration. I’d like to see it submitted in a peer reviewed journal but maybe that will come. Still it’s nice to see people for new approaches. It’s a breath of fresh air. I like it when there are actual research rather than hype. Hopefully the days of the “scale it up and magic will happen” are counted.

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04871](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04871)

#### Introduction to IncusOS

_Tags: tech, virtualization, containers, infrastructure, linux, incus_

I didn’t know about this project. This sounds interesting, smart use of mkosi to make an Incus tailored system.

[https://linuxcontainers.org/incus-os/](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus-os/)

#### Linux process priorities demystified

_Tags: tech, linux, kernel, processes, multithreading_

Does a nice job explaining how the scheduling can be investigated from outside the kernel. It is a good introduction on the topic.

[https://www.sigma-star.at/blog/2022/02/linux-proc-prios/](https://www.sigma-star.at/blog/2022/02/linux-proc-prios/)

#### Announcing Magika 1.0: now faster, smarter, and rebuilt in Rust

_Tags: tech, filesystem, foss_

Looks more and more like an interesting solution for file type detection.

[https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/11/announcing-magika-10-now-faster-smarter.html?m=1](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/11/announcing-magika-10-now-faster-smarter.html?m=1)

#### The (lazy) Git UI You Didn’t Know You Need

_Tags: tech, git, version-control, tools_

Nice tour of LazyGit. I keep hearing good things about it, I should really try it.

[https://www.bwplotka.dev/2025/lazygit/](https://www.bwplotka.dev/2025/lazygit/)

#### Imperative to relational

_Tags: tech, databases, sql, learning_

Long but nice post about all the things you need to figure out about working with databases when the only thing you know is imperative languages.

[https://madhadron.com/imperative_to_relational.html](https://madhadron.com/imperative_to_relational.html)

#### Automated Equality Checks in C++ with Reflection (C++26)

_Tags: tech, c++, metaprogramming_

Another nice use of the upcoming C++ reflection feature.

[https://lemire.me/blog/2025/11/09/automated-equality-checks-in-c-with-reflection-c26/](https://lemire.me/blog/2025/11/09/automated-equality-checks-in-c-with-reflection-c26/)

#### Hardening the C++ Standard Library at massive scale

_Tags: tech, c++, safety, security, standard_

Interesting work from Apple and Google to have better hardening in libc++. It’s nice to see it ripples through the upcoming C++26 standard as well.

[https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3773097](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3773097)

#### channels-console: Real-time monitoring, metrics and logs for Rust channels

_Tags: tech, rust, debugging, distributed, multithreading_

Early days but this looks like interesting tooling to inspect and debug programs using Rust channels.

[https://github.com/pawurb/channels-console](https://github.com/pawurb/channels-console)

#### The state of the Rust dependency ecosystem

_Tags: tech, rust, ecosystem, supply-chain_

Interesting analysis of the crates ecosystem. It shows quite well some of the challenges and weaknesses. Nothing to worry about yet about the ecosystem health overall. Still, you should probably be careful when picking dependencies.

[https://00f.net/2025/10/17/state-of-the-rust-ecosystem/](https://00f.net/2025/10/17/state-of-the-rust-ecosystem/)

#### GPU Glossary

_Tags: tech, gpu, hardware, learning_

Looks heavy on the NVidia specifics but it looks like a very comprehensive view of the important concepts in a GPU.

[https://modal.com/gpu-glossary](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary)

#### The “Dependency Cutout” Workflow Pattern

_Tags: tech, foss, economics, supply-chain, community_

This is indeed the best way to handle your open source dependencies. I got concerns about the ability to sell that to management though because of the extra steps. It’s also probably why you want to have an OSPO in your company, it’s a good way to lower the barrier for developers to contribute this way.

[https://blog.glyph.im/2025/11/dependency-cutout-workflow-pattern.html](https://blog.glyph.im/2025/11/dependency-cutout-workflow-pattern.html)

#### 100% coverage is not that trivial

_Tags: tech, tests, tdd, coverage_

In a large codebase it’s not a given indeed. That’s why you want integration tests to get there.

[https://blog.ploeh.dk/2025/11/10/100-coverage-is-not-that-trivial/](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2025/11/10/100-coverage-is-not-that-trivial/)

#### Composable Tests

_Tags: tech, tests, tdd_

This is maybe the property of tests which is the most easily misunderstood. It’s not always easy to respect it as well.

[https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/composable-tests](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/composable-tests)

#### Forget Chatbots. You Need a Notebook.

_Tags: tech, note-taking, science, research, productivity_

I had a few moment like this in my life. I definitely recommend it. I’ve never been more productive than isolated in a mountain with only books, notebooks and pens.

IMPORTANT: Generate FULL NARRATION SCRIPTS that will be read word-for-word during the video. 
DO NOT generate outlines or bullet points. Write complete sentences that flow naturally as spoken audio.

For each idea, provide the following in JSON format:

{
  "ideas": [
    {
      "title": "Catchy title for the video",
      "hook": "The exact words to say in the first 3 seconds to grab attention (≤12 words)",
      "key_points": ["Full sentence 1 to narrate (10-15 words)", "...", "...", "...", "..."],
      "cta": "The exact call to action to say at the end",
      "hashtags": ["#hashtag1", "#hashtag2", "#hashtag3"],
      "target_audience": "Specific target audience description"
    }
  ]
}

EXAMPLES OF FULL NARRATION SCRIPTS:

Example 1 (Tech Topic):
{
  "title": "Unlock the iPhone 15 Action Button",
  "hook": "Stop scrolling, Action Button turns your iPhone into automation central.",
  "key_points": [
    "Assign the Action Button to run Home scenes, launching lights, music, thermostat.",
    "Use Shortcuts stacks so one press fires focus mode, reminders, hydration timer.",
    "Set a travel press to message ETA, enable driving focus, open Maps instantly.",
    "Combine double presses with NFC tags to trigger security cameras and garage doors.",
    "Record a Siri phrase that toggles custom actions when the button is held."
  ],
  "cta": "Follow for tomorrow's tutorial showing exactly how to build these button stacks.",
  "hashtags": ["#iPhone15", "#ActionButton", "#Automation"],
  "target_audience": "iPhone owners who love smart home automations"
}

Example 2 (Food Topic):
{
  "title": "Creamiest Scrambled Eggs in Five Steps",
  "hook": "These scrambled eggs finish like custard—here's the five-step routine.",
  "key_points": [
    "Start on low heat, stirring constantly so curds stay velvety and tiny.",
    "Lift the pan off heat every fifteen seconds to halt overcooking instantly.",
    "Fold in butter while whisking gently; it emulsifies air into ridiculous creaminess.",
    "Finish with creme fraiche and chives, then season with flaky salt right away.",
    "Serve immediately on warm plates so residual heat keeps them silky, never rubbery."
  ],
  "cta": "Save this so breakfast tomorrow tastes like a hotel brunch at home.",
  "hashtags": ["#CookingHacks", "#Breakfast", "#EggRecipes"],
  "target_audience": "Home cooks craving fast gourmet breakfasts"
}

Example 3 (Productivity Topic):
{
  "title": "Two-Minute Priority List Reset",
  "hook": "Need focus fast? This two-minute list trick saved my mornings.",
  "key_points": [
    "Before touching your phone, write the single mission that defines today's success.",
    "Add two support tasks max so the brain sees achievable, finite commitments.",
    "Circle the hardest task and start immediately, even if progress feels microscopic.",
    "Review the list after lunch; cross-offs trigger dopamine that fuels afternoon momentum.",
    "Capture stray ideas on another page so the core list stays sacred."
  ],
  "cta": "Try it tomorrow and DM me if your focus finally sticks.",
  "hashtags": ["#ProductivityHacks", "#MorningRoutine", "#FocusTips"],
  "target_audience": "Busy students and professionals fighting scattered mornings"
}

Make the scripts:
- Written in natural, conversational spoken language
- Full sentences that can be read aloud exactly as written
- Engaging and authentic like you're talking to a friend
- Attention-grabbing hooks that stop the scroll
- Hooks must be very short (max 12 words) but punchy and curiosity-driving
- Detailed enough to understand without seeing the video
- Platform-optimized for short-form video
- Provide 5-10 key_points for every idea
- Each key_point must be a complete sentence of 10-15 words, not a fragment
- Key_points should read like sequential narration, with each sentence advancing the same mini-story
