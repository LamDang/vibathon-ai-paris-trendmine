Let’s go for my web review for the week 2025-46.

#### Valve is about to win the console generation

_Tags: tech, valve, kde, hardware, gaming, desktop_

Early days, we’ll need to see the pricing and reviews. I’m obviously excited to see KDE going in even more consumer devices by default. Let’s hope it sells even better than the Steam Deck.

[https://xeiaso.net/blog/2025/valve-is-about-to-win-the-console-generation/](https://xeiaso.net/blog/2025/valve-is-about-to-win-the-console-generation/)

#### Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun To Depart And Launch AI Start-Up Focused On ‘World Models’

_Tags: tech, business, ai, machine-learning, gpt_

I was actually wondering when this would happen. Was just a matter of time, would have expected this move a couple of months ago.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metas-chief-ai-scientist-yann-lecun-depart-and-launch-ai-start-focused-world-models](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metas-chief-ai-scientist-yann-lecun-depart-and-launch-ai-start-focused-world-models)

#### Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks

_Tags: tech, ai, machine-learning, reasoning, research_

Clearly needs further exploration. I’d like to see it submitted in a peer reviewed journal but maybe that will come. Still it’s nice to see people for new approaches. It’s a breath of fresh air. I like it when there are actual research rather than hype. Hopefully the days of the “scale it up and magic will happen” are counted.

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04871](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04871)

#### Introduction to IncusOS

_Tags: tech, virtualization, containers, infrastructure, linux, incus_

I didn’t know about this project. This sounds interesting, smart use of mkosi to make an Incus tailored system.

[https://linuxcontainers.org/incus-os/](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus-os/)

#### Linux process priorities demystified

_Tags: tech, linux, kernel, processes, multithreading_

Does a nice job explaining how the scheduling can be investigated from outside the kernel. It is a good introduction on the topic.

[https://www.sigma-star.at/blog/2022/02/linux-proc-prios/](https://www.sigma-star.at/blog/2022/02/linux-proc-prios/)

#### Announcing Magika 1.0: now faster, smarter, and rebuilt in Rust

_Tags: tech, filesystem, foss_

Looks more and more like an interesting solution for file type detection.

[https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/11/announcing-magika-10-now-faster-smarter.html?m=1](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/11/announcing-magika-10-now-faster-smarter.html?m=1)

#### The (lazy) Git UI You Didn’t Know You Need

_Tags: tech, git, version-control, tools_

Nice tour of LazyGit. I keep hearing good things about it, I should really try it.

[https://www.bwplotka.dev/2025/lazygit/](https://www.bwplotka.dev/2025/lazygit/)

#### Imperative to relational

_Tags: tech, databases, sql, learning_

Long but nice post about all the things you need to figure out about working with databases when the only thing you know is imperative languages.

[https://madhadron.com/imperative_to_relational.html](https://madhadron.com/imperative_to_relational.html)

#### Automated Equality Checks in C++ with Reflection (C++26)

_Tags: tech, c++, metaprogramming_

Another nice use of the upcoming C++ reflection feature.

[https://lemire.me/blog/2025/11/09/automated-equality-checks-in-c-with-reflection-c26/](https://lemire.me/blog/2025/11/09/automated-equality-checks-in-c-with-reflection-c26/)

#### Hardening the C++ Standard Library at massive scale

_Tags: tech, c++, safety, security, standard_

Interesting work from Apple and Google to have better hardening in libc++. It’s nice to see it ripples through the upcoming C++26 standard as well.

[https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3773097](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3773097)

#### channels-console: Real-time monitoring, metrics and logs for Rust channels

_Tags: tech, rust, debugging, distributed, multithreading_

Early days but this looks like interesting tooling to inspect and debug programs using Rust channels.

[https://github.com/pawurb/channels-console](https://github.com/pawurb/channels-console)

#### The state of the Rust dependency ecosystem

_Tags: tech, rust, ecosystem, supply-chain_

Interesting analysis of the crates ecosystem. It shows quite well some of the challenges and weaknesses. Nothing to worry about yet about the ecosystem health overall. Still, you should probably be careful when picking dependencies.

[https://00f.net/2025/10/17/state-of-the-rust-ecosystem/](https://00f.net/2025/10/17/state-of-the-rust-ecosystem/)

#### GPU Glossary

_Tags: tech, gpu, hardware, learning_

Looks heavy on the NVidia specifics but it looks like a very comprehensive view of the important concepts in a GPU.

[https://modal.com/gpu-glossary](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary)

#### The “Dependency Cutout” Workflow Pattern

_Tags: tech, foss, economics, supply-chain, community_

This is indeed the best way to handle your open source dependencies. I got concerns about the ability to sell that to management though because of the extra steps. It’s also probably why you want to have an OSPO in your company, it’s a good way to lower the barrier for developers to contribute this way.

[https://blog.glyph.im/2025/11/dependency-cutout-workflow-pattern.html](https://blog.glyph.im/2025/11/dependency-cutout-workflow-pattern.html)

#### 100% coverage is not that trivial

_Tags: tech, tests, tdd, coverage_

In a large codebase it’s not a given indeed. That’s why you want integration tests to get there.

[https://blog.ploeh.dk/2025/11/10/100-coverage-is-not-that-trivial/](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2025/11/10/100-coverage-is-not-that-trivial/)

#### Composable Tests

_Tags: tech, tests, tdd_

This is maybe the property of tests which is the most easily misunderstood. It’s not always easy to respect it as well.

[https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/composable-tests](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/composable-tests)

#### Forget Chatbots. You Need a Notebook.

_Tags: tech, note-taking, science, research, productivity_

I had a few moment like this in my life. I definitely recommend it. I’ve never been more productive than isolated in a mountain with only books, notebooks and pens.
