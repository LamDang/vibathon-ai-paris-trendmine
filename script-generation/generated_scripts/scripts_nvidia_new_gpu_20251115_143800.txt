Make the scripts:
- Written in natural, conversational spoken language
- Full sentences that can be read aloud exactly as written
- Engaging and authentic like you're talking to a friend
- Attention-grabbing hooks that stop the scroll
- Hooks must be very short (max 12 words) but punchy and curiosity-driving
- Detailed enough to understand without seeing the video
- Platform-optimized for short-form video
- Provide 5-10 key_points for every idea
- Each key_point must be a complete sentence of 10-15 words, not a fragment
